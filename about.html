            <span class="dropcap">H</span><p><span class="first-sentence">ello and thanks</span> for visiting my website! I'm Daria Wu, a San Francisco Bay Area native. I started teaching myself web design/development when I was 12 and obsessed with making my Neopets shop the best of them all. I've since expanded my knowledge by building websites for various organizations, designing with the Adobe Suite, and obtaining a degree in Computer Science.</p> 
            <p>I have extensive experience designing and building web sites that are responsive and consistent across different browsers and platforms. I constantly challenge myself to learn new methods and technologies to make my web sites work more efficiently, and deliver an awesome user experience.</p>
            <p>I love puzzles of all kinds - crosswords, jigsaw puzzles, sudoku, logic puzzles, you name it! I'm also passionate about food and mystery novels.</p>
            <p>Here's my <a href="/dariaw-resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resum&eacute;</a>.</p>
            <p>Interested in working together? Just want to drop a note saying hi? Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
